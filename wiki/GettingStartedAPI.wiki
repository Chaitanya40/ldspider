==Start crawling==
We instruct the crawler to start crawling pages by calling an evaluate method.
In this example, we use the breadth first strategy, which limits depth of the traversal (number of rounds), as well as the maximum number of URIs crawled per round.
The breadth first strategy can be configured to crawl the schema information, in which case it will do an extra round to get the schema information of the last round.
{{{
int depth = 2;
int maxURIs = 100;
boolean includeABox = true;
boolean includeTBox = false;

c.evaluateBreadthFirst(frontier, depth, maxURIs, includeABox, includeTBox);
}}}
